# Recruiting Dashboard

I created the backend of a web app for job applicants and HR representatives. Users can create job postings, apply to posted jobs, review job applicant information, make job offers, and accept job offers. Includes SQL and Python scripts and sample data. 

The tables are created in a MySQL database and populated with sample data using INSERT statements. 

I also wrote a Python script to scrub over 30,000 records of every accredited college in the United States to include school names as a field in some of the tables. The original file as well as the scrubbed file are included.
